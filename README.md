## Description

The final version of the project I participated in at the University of Copenhagen in terms of 15 ECTS Project Outside the Course Scope, under the supervision of Prof. Oswin Krause, in cooperation with the Department of Biomedical Sciences, with Prof. JÃ¸rgen K. Kanters and Dr. Jonas L. Isaksen as the advisors.

The repository contains the implementation used to generate all results presented in the ``report.pdf``. However, as the code was not part of the evaluation, it is undocumented and requires structural refactoring.
